# PayByte for WooCommerce Plugin
Accept Crypto payments in your WordPress WooCommerce website using PayByte.

PayByte is a crypto payment processor that acts in a non-custodial fashion when merchants accept payments from their customers. In this scenario, funds go straight from a customer’s wallet to the merchant’s wallet, without any middlemen involved in the transaction. It’s almost trustless!
  
PayByte’s key competitive advantage is that it charges flat and fixed fees based on transaction volume, while all other processors charge percentage-based fees.
  
Paybyte doesn’t need your Private Keys, by leveraging the power of the Blockchain, PayByte uses your XPUB (Extended Public Key) to generate addresses on your behalf that can be used just to watch incoming transactions. As a result, funds go directly to your wallet and in doing so eliminate middleman from the payment process.
  
PayByte is now available on the official Wordpress Plugin Directory. Merchants can install the plugin directly from inside Wordpress, or download it from the the [Wordpress website](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paybyte-for-woocommerce/).
